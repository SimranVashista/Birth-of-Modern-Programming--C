<font size="4">
 C is a High Level Language which was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie in year 1970's at Bell Labs.<br>
<h2> Basis For C Language Creation</h2>
1.It was designed to serve the following purpose that other programming language could not serve at that time
<br>
<br> a) Easy to Learn.
<br> b) Structured Programming.
<br> c) Able to handle efficiency and readability with increased amount of complexity(In Those time).
<br><br>
2. C was originally developed to write an operating system called Unix.
<br><br>
<h2>History and Evolution</h2>
<br>
1. Prior to C,programmer had to choose between languages that could serve the best for different sort of problems.
<br><br>
2. Fortran could be used to write fairly efficient programs for scientific application it was not very good for system code.
<br><br>
3. Basic was easy to learn ,it wasn't very powerful and it's lack of structure made its usefulness, questionable for large programs(See, "Basic" is true to its meaning).
<br><br>
4. Assembly language can be used to produce efficient program but not easy to learn or use effectively also debugging it is quite difficult.
<br><br>
5. Also all these Basic,COBOL,Fortran users not designed around structured principles.
<br><br>
6.They used to use "GOTO" Labels for writing programs which all of the go give you a "Spaghetti Code" with increase in complexity. 
<br><br>
7. PASCAL were structured but they were not designed for efficiency and failed to include certain features necessary to make them applicable  to wide range of programs.
<br><br>
8. So,prior to C,no language could serve the structural and a user friendly environment for programmers to code.
<br><br>
10. C was the result of a development process of language called BCPL developed by Martin Richards.
<br><br>
11. C was formally standardized in December 1989,when ANSI(American National Standard Institute) adopted C.
<br>
<br>
12. The creation of C is considered to marking beginning for the world of programming language ,as C is different.
